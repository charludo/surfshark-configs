# THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL PROJECT

I am simply using Surfshark OpenVPN config files within my [nix config](https://github.com/charludo/nix) and got tired of the hash
of the config file on Surfshark's constantly changing, requiring manual intervention when
rebuilding my machines.

This repo offers an arbitrarily-old (depending on when I see the need to update) version of the config files
which I can download in my nix config instead, and whose hash only changes when I manually update the file on here.
